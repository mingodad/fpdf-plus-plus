An effort to have a simple and efficient c++ pdf library based on porting the FPDF PHP library.

I'm uzing lazyc++ to write the code so you'll need to use it too, you can get it here:

http://www.lazycplusplus.com/

There is only two files that you should add to your project.

For documentation the fpdf documentation should be used:

http://www.fpdf.org/
